# Scratch-GPT
This repository contains Scratch GPT, a Generative Pretrained Transformer model built entirely from scratch. The model's architecture includes word and positional embeddings, multi-headed self-attention mechanisms, and stacked Transformer blocks. It is trained on Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' but can be retrained with various corpuses.
